# MkDocs KaTeX SSR Plugin

A MkDocs plugin that renders LaTeX math on the server side using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), offering faster load times, layout stability, and optional offline support.

## Why Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

Traditional client-side rendering relies on JavaScript in the browser to convert LaTeX strings into HTML. This can lead to:

- **Layout Shift**: Content jumps as math loads.
- **Slower Performance**: The browser must download and parse the KaTeX library before rendering.
- **Dependency**: Requires client-side JavaScript execution.

**MkDocs KaTeX SSR** pre-renders all math during the `mkdocs build` process using a local Node.js process. The resulting HTML contains ready-to-view markup.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Uses a persistent Node.js process to render equations efficiently without spawning a new process for every item.
- **Offline Support**: Optional "Offline Mode" copies all necessary CSS, fonts, and scripts to your site directory, removing external CDN dependencies.
- **Smart Asset Management**: Separate configuration for server-side processing scripts (like `mhchem`) and client-side interactive scripts (like `copy-tex`).
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed build-time logging for each page tracking formula counts, cache hits, and processing speeds.
- **Clean Output**: Aggressive warning suppression for a quieter build log.
